I'm a lifelong learner.  I came from a Java background but am now fully immersed in the world of web development.  The frontier nature of the web today is exciting.  There is so much to learn and so many ways to solve problems.  I spent the past two years creating native web applications in javascript.  In the choice between faster, better and cheaper, I believe that good software practices today can allow you to do all three.
