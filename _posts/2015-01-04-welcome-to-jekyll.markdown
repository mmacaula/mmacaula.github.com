I just migrated my blog from my [old site](http://michaelmacaulay.blogspot.com/) on blogger to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll docs][jekyll] to make it easier to do a blog post.  It's so much easier to write code snippets (like below) which will be my primary subject in this blog.  I hope to *regularly* update my blog to share things that will help others who might be having similar problems.  

{% highlight javascript %}
var foo = 'bar';
setTimeout(function(){
	doSomething();
}, 200);

{% endhighlight %}
